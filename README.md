## [The RHex project](https://rhexman.github.io/RHex/)

This project contains two primary applications, RHexSwing3D and RHexCast3D, that create realistic dynamic 3D computer simulations of, respectively, a swung fly line, leader, tippet and fly combination in a moving stream, and a rod and line during an aerial cast.
