## [RHex](https://rhexman.github.io/RHex/)

This project contains two primary applications, RHexSwing3D and RHexCast3D, that create realistic dynamic 3D computer simulations of, respectively, a swung fly line, leader, tippet and fly combination in a moving stream, and a rod and line during an aerial cast.

## [Trout](https://rhexman.github.io/Trout)

Trying to make sense of the bugs trout eat, and what that means for the fly-fisher.  Includes a novel spatio-temporal form of hatch chart and supporting discussion.  Also includes two longer documents that are practical keys to the insects that are of particular interest to selectively feeding California trout, and therefore, also of interest to the angler.
